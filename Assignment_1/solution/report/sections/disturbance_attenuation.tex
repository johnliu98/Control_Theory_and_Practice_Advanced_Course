This exercise deals with the construction of a controller whose function is
twofold: it tracks the reference signal and attenuates disturbances. The
requirements of the system are such that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The rise time for a step change in the reference signal is less than
  $0.2$ s
  \item The overshoot is less than $10\%$
  \item For a step in the disturbance, $|y(t)| \leq 1\ \forall t$ and
  $|y(t)| \leq 0.1$ for $t > 0.5$ s
  \item Since the signals are scaled, the control signal obeys $|u(t)| \leq 1\
  \forall t$
\end{itemize}

The transfer functions of the plant $G(s)$ and the disturbance $G_d(s)$ have
been estimated to expressions \ref{eq:421_G} and \ref{eq:421_Gd} respectively.
The target of this exercise is to construct the $F_r(s), F_y(s)$ transfer
functions in such a way that all four of the above requirements are met.

\begin{equation}
  G(s) = \dfrac{20}{(s+1)((\dfrac{s}{20})^2 + \dfrac{s}{20} + 1)}
  \label{eq:421_G}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  G_d(s) = \dfrac{10}{s+1}
  \label{eq:421_Gd}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Exercice 1}

Control action is needed at least at frequencies where $|G_d(j\omega)| > 1$;
this expression is valid for all $\omega < \omega_c = 9.9473$ rad/s\footnote{
this is the crossover frequency of $G_d$}. Hence, the minimal frequency interval
where control is needed is $[0, 9.9473]$ rad/s. The controller $F_y(s)$ that
shall be designed here will be such that
$$L(s) = F_y(s)G(s) = \dfrac{\omega_c}{s}$$

We will approach the design of $F_y$ in two ways: one where it $F_y$ is
improper, and one where it is proper.

\subsubsection{$F_y$ is improper}

The first approach is the most simplistic one:
$$F_y(s) = \dfrac{\omega_c}{sG(s)} = \dfrac{\omega_c (s+1)((\dfrac{s}{20})^2 + \dfrac{s}{20} + 1)}{20s}$$
This means that $F_y$ is not proper since the number of its poles is less than
the number of its zeros. Although this controller displays good disturbance
attenuation (figure \ref{fig:bode_2.1_dy}), the amplitude of the output for a
step disturbance does not meet the third requirement for $|y(t)| \leq 0.1$ for
$t > 0.5$ s.

\subsubsection{$F_y$ is proper}

In order for $F_y$ to be proper, we add the minimum number of poles required,
which is two, $p_1, p_2$, such that
$$F_y(s) = \dfrac{\omega_c}{sG(s)} \cdot \dfrac{p_1 \cdot p_2}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)}$$
and in order for $L(s) \approx \dfrac{\omega_c}{s}$ we choose their location
so that the frequency response of the closed-loop transfer function from $d$ to
$y$ matches that of the previous case, where $F_y$ was improper. In this case,
the two poles should be positioned away from $\omega_c$. Such a case was
found to be valid experimentally for $p_1 = p_2 \geq 50\omega_c$. Thus, the
poles were chosen as $p_1 = p_2 = 50\omega_c$. As is evident in figures
\ref{fig:bode_2.1_dy} and \ref{fig:step_response_2.1}, the frequency response of
the closed loop transfer function from $d$ to $y$ and the response of the output
for a unit disturbance are equivalent in the frequency band where control action
is appropriate.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Exercice 2}

Since the previous controller did not exhibit adequate performance and did not
meet the specified requirements, we now attempt to tune it in accordance to a
desire to include integral action. We will again consider two possible designs.

\subsubsection{$F_y$ is improper}

We take $F_y$ to be of the form $F_y(s) = \frac{s+\omega_I}{s}G^{-1}(s)G_d(s)$
as a starting point. Although $F_y$ is now improper, we can design $\omega_I$ so
that our third requirement is met. Indeed, if we choose
$\omega_I = 0.5 \omega_c$, then $|y(t)| \leq 0.1, \forall t \geq 0.5$s and,
$\forall t: |y(t)| < 1$. This behaviour is illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:step_response_2.2} in blue colour.


\subsubsection{$F_y$ is proper}

Since $F_y$ needs to be proper, we need to add two poles to it; hence $F_y$ is
now formed as
$$F_y(s) = \dfrac{s+\omega_I}{s} \cdot \dfrac{p_1 \cdot p_2}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} \cdot G^{-1}(s)G_d(s)$$
The location of these poles should be such that when $G_d \approx 1$, e.g.
for $\omega < \omega_c$, the controller should contain the inverse of the
system. This means that $p_1,p_2$ should be larger than $\omega_c$. A choice of
$p_1 = p_2 = 5\omega_c = 10\omega_I$ is appropriate since the poles are
adequately far from the crossover frequency of the disturbance and the third
requirement is satisfied, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:step_response_2.2}
in red colour.

  \scalebox{0.8}{\input{./figures/step_response_2.2.tex}}
  \caption{The response of the transfer function from $d$ to $y$ for a step in
    the disturbance when $F_y$ is proper (\texttt{red}) and improper
    (\texttt{blue}). $\omega_I = 0.5 \omega_c$, $p_1 = p_2 = 5\omega_c$.}
  \label{fig:step_response_2.2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Exercises 3 and 4}

In this subsection we try to bridge all the gaps and meet all specifications.
In order to do so, first we add a lead component to the controller, so that
$F_y$ is now given by
$$F_y(s) = \dfrac{s+\omega_I}{s} \cdot K \dfrac{\tau_D s + 1}{\beta \tau_D s + 1}
\cdot \dfrac{p_1 \cdot p_2}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} \cdot G^{-1}G_d$$
Since there is no specification for the phase margin, we can set it to a
sensible $30^{\circ}$ at a crossover frequency larger than the actual one, so
that $\omega_c$ is well inside the control region, $\omega_c + 6 \approx 15$
rad/s, for which $\beta = 0.6565, \tau_D = 0.0826$ and $K = 1.2557$.

As for the prefilter, it is given by $F_r$:
$$F_r = \dfrac{1}{\tau s + 1}$$
Through a process of trial and error, if $\tau = 0.1$, then all requirements
are met. Specifically, controllers $F_y, F_r$, with coefficients given in
table \ref{tbl:ex34} make the system behave as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The rise time for a step change in the reference signal is
    $0.1561 < 0.2$s
  \item The overshoot is $6.5716 < 10\%$
  \item For a step in the disturbance, $|y(t)| \leq 1\ \forall t$ and
  $|y(t)| \leq 0.1$ for $t > 0.445$s
  \item The control signal obeys $|u(t)| \leq 0.511 \leq 1\ \forall t$
\end{itemize}
