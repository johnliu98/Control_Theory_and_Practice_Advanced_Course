This report was drafted for KTH's EL2520 - Control Theory and Practice,
Advanced course during VT16. It is split into two parts: in the first one, we
design a lead-lag controller in order to control a process under specific
requirements.  The second part assumes the first one and furthers the work into
attenuation of disturbances as well as reference tracking.
