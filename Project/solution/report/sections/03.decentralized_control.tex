This and the next section are organised as follows: the system is driven to
equilibrium by means of the controller, or, if it is not feasible (i.e. in the
non-minimum phase case) close to the reference point. Then, the system is
subjected to (a) a step change of $5\%$ in one of the inputs (marked with orange
colour), (b) a disturbance $w_1$ which, physically, is the pouring of a cup of
water directly in either tank 1 or 2 (marked with purple colour), and (c) a
disturbance $w_2$ which, physically, is the opening of the extra outlet
connected to tanks 3 or 4 (marked with green colour).

Figure \ref{fig:mp_411} illustrates the response of the minimum phase system
to step input changes and introduction of disturbances. Table \ref{tbl:mp_411}
summarizes some important performance metrics under this experiment.

    decentralized controller. At time $t = 245$ a step of $-5\%$ is introduced
    in $u_1$. At time $t = 360$ a cup of water is poured into tank 1. At time
    $t = 487$ the extra outlet of tank 3 is opened.}

\subsection*{Exercise 4.1.2}
The non-minimum phase system reacts slower both in its step response and the
attenuation of disturbances, although it takes both systems roughly the same
time to recover from the introduction of $w_1$. Furthermore, the non-minimum
phase case system is more sensitive to $w_2$, the disturbance introduced from
the upper tanks, than the minimum phase system: not only it takes twice the
time to recover from $w_2$, but the amplitude of the oscillation in the
counterpart tank is significantly larger.
