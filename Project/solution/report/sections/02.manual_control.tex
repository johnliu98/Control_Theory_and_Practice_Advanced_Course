\subsection*{Exercise 2.2.1}

Table \ref{tbl:221} presents the experimental and calculated steady-state values
for the height in each tank for both the minimum and non-minimum phase cases.
It is evident that not all real values agree with their theoretically derived
ones. This is reasonable: non-zero steady-state in this setting means that the
amount of flow coming into a tank is equal to that coming out of it, during a
given amount of time. This means that there are infinite stationary points,
depending on the amount of water present in the tanks at time $t=0$, or at later
points of time.

\begin{table}[H]\centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    Height of tank i & minimum phase [cm] / calculated & non-minimum phase [cm] / calculated\\ \hline
    1                & 17.5 / 26.545      & 28 / 27.0478           \\
    2                & 22 / 27.0478       & 14 / 26.5450           \\
    3                & 6.5 / 9.3885       & 12 / 10.8637            \\
    4                & 7.5 / 8.7095       & 9.5 / 10.0779           \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Steady-state water height in each tank, experimentally derived and
      calculated from the system's model. Initially the tanks were
      empty. The inputs were set to $0.5 u_{max} = 7.5 V$ and the system was
      permitted to reach steady-state from these initial conditions.}

Figure \ref{fig:222} shows the step responses from when one input is ON for
the minimum and non-minimum phase cases.

\caption{Step responses for the minimum phase case (left) and non-minumum phase
  case (right). The input step was set to $0.5 u_{max} = 7.5V$. The vertical
  axes show the height of water in each tank in percentage of its maximum height
  value. Figures (a) and (c) correspond to input 1 being ON, while figures
  (b) and (d) correspond to input 2 being ON.}

The system is indeed coupled. In accordance to their respective RGA matrices,
we can see that, in the minimum phase case, input $i$ drives tank $i$ but is
coupled to output $j$, while, in the non-minimum phase case, input $i$ drives
tank $j$ but is coupled to output $i$.

\subsection*{Exercise 2.2.3}

We set the reference levels to $50\%$ of the maximum height for tanks 1 and 2.
In the minimum phase case we found it easier to control the system, and the
transient, in our experiment, was roughly 500 seconds. Contrary to this, the
non-minimum phase case is much harder to control manually, if it is actually
feasible to do so. In the end we could not reach our goal, however, in any case
it is reasonable to assume that its transient would be more than in the
minimum phase case.

\subsection*{Exercise 2.2.4}

Among the most important differences between the minimum and non-minimum phase
cases are the actual physical setup of the plant for each case, the fact that
the latter is more difficult to control by hand, and more difficult to obtain
an intuitive understanding due to the increased complexity of the intrinsics
of the physical process itself.
