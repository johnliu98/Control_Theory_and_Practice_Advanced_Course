This report was a summary of our experience in modelling, controlling, and
experimenting in real conditions with the physical process of the four-tank
coupled system. After determining crucial parameters of the plant, controllers
were designed in order to obtain a practical understanding of the difficulty
of control pertaining to minimum and non-minimum phase case plants. Both the
decentralized and robust controllers were proved to be successful in their
operation, albeit with different performances. Lastly, we note on the
increased arduousness of control of non-minimum phase case systems.
