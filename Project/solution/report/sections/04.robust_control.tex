Figure \ref{fig:mp_421} illustrates the response of the minimum phase system
to step input changes and introduction of disturbances. Table \ref{tbl:mp_421}
summarizes some important performance metrics under this experiment.

  \caption{Response of the minimum phase system while under control from a
    controller derived with the Glover-McFarlae method. At time $t = 292$ a
    step of $-5\%$ is introduced in $u_1$. At time $t = 504$ a cup of water is
    poured into tank 1. At time $t = 688$ the extra outlet of tank 3 is opened.}

to step input changes and introduction of disturbances. Table \ref{tbl:nmp_421}
summarizes some important performance metrics under this experiment.

\subsection*{Exercise 4.2.2}
The Glover-McFarlane controllers make each system respond quicker to steps
introduced in the input, although the rejection of disturbances is somewhat
slower, especially in the non-minimum phase case. However, on the whole,
the amplitude of the oscillations caused by the introduction of disturbances
are significantly decreased.

\subsection*{Exercise 4.2.3}
Overall, we notice that the response of the non-minimum phase system is slower
than that of the minimum-phase system, while the introduction of disturbances
that involve tanks 3 and 4 are more influential on the former system. Overall,
the non-minimum phase system is proved to be harder to control due to constraints
relative to its nature.
